# Python
### Programming for Everybody
This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, you’ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

#### Getting Started with Python
This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python. The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 3.

 #### Data Structures
 This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course will cover Chapters 6-10 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. This course covers Python 3.

 #### Accessing Web Data
 This course will show how one can treat the Internet as a source of data. We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs. We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. This course will cover Chapters 11-13 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. To succeed in this course, you should be familiar with the material covered in Chapters 1-10 of the textbook and the first two courses in this specialization. These topics include variables and expressions, conditional execution (loops, branching, and try/except), functions, Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples), and manipulating files. This course covers Python 3.

Installing and Using Python
In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Not all activities in this module are
required for this class so please read the "Using Python in this Class" material for details.

Chapter One: Why We Program (continued)
In the first chapter we try to cover the "big picture" of programming so you get a "table of contents" of the rest
of the book. Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapte...

Chapter Three: Conditional Code
In this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code
where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes "choices".

Chapter Four: Functions
This is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The
programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but...

Loops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do
something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the pr...
